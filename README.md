1. joy: character will jump up;
2. idle or sad: character will return to the ground, sadness will let the character move faster than idle do;
3. New emotion: Surprise, set the new face, character will run in panic(rotate arround the (1, 0, 0) position);
                This is more likely the fearness will do, however, I found that the fearness is very hard to be detected.
                So I finally choose surprise.
